      India is witnessing the age of science and technology. There is huge demand for technical education in modern era.
      The pattern of life evolving in this era is very much different from the one, we would find in our society even
      some
      fifty years back. Technical Education imparts knowledge of specific trade, craft or profession. General education
      has been substituted by professional & technical education in many cases. Technical education offers good
      opportunity for employment and successful career.
      On 31st March 2007, a trust “Bansal Educational Trust”, ventured into the field of education to undertake the
      great
      task of establishing an educational institute to provide quality education to the students of Lucknow as well as
      adjoining regions. Having the privilege of being the state capital of Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow still lacked in being
      a
      hub for quality technical education, Sri G.S. Agrawal voiced the feelings of the concerned parents about the want
      of
      educational facilities and the urgent need to match the existing gap - between the education seekers and education
      facilitators.

    <h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: min(max(1.2rem, 3vw), 2.1rem); color: #007bff;">About Lucknow
    </h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;  font-size: min(max(0.8rem, 1.7vw), 1.2rem);">
      Lucknow is the capital city of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, and is also the administrative headquarters of
      the eponymous district and division.
      It is the fourteenth-most populous city and the twelfth-most populous urban agglomeration of India.
      Lucknow has always been a multicultural city that flourished as a North Indian cultural and artistic hub, and the
      seat of power of Nawabs in the 18th and 19th centuries.
      It continues to be an important centre of governance, administration, education, commerce, aerospace, finance,
      pharmaceuticals, technology, design, culture, tourism, music and poetry.
      The city stands at an elevation of approximately 123 metres (404 ft) above sea level.
      Lucknow city had an area of 402 sq km till December 2019, when 88 villages were added to the municipal limits and
      the area increased to 631 sq km.
      Bounded on the east by Barabanki, on the west by Unnao, on the south by Raebareli and in the north by Sitapur and
      Hardoi, Lucknow sits on the northwestern shore of the Gomti River.
      As of 2008, there were 110 wards in the city. Morphologically, three clear demarcations exist: The Central
      business district, which is a fully built up area, comprises Hazratganj, Aminabad and Chowk.
      <br>
      <b>Bada Imambada:</b> <br>
      Bada Imambada is famous for its maze called 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa' in Hindi. It is built of identical 2.5 feet wide
      passageways like the one shown in this photograph.
      Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, lies in the middle of the Heritage Arc. This bustling city, famed for its
      Nawabi era finesse and amazing food, is a unique mix of the ancient and the modern. It is home to extraordinary
      monuments depicting a fascinating blend of ancient, colonial and oriental architecture."
      The Bara Imambara in Lucknow was built in six years as ordinary people used to work in the day building up the
      edifice, while noblemen demolished it, so that the labourers could be given employment.
      <br>
      <b>Lucknow Zoo:</b>
      <br>
      The Lucknow Zoo is one of the city’s main tourist attractions. Frequented by locals and outsiders alike, this zoo
      has been instrumental in educating Lucknow’s masses about the importance of the environment and preserving
      wildlife. The Lucknow Zoo is home 447 mammals, 348 birds, and 57 reptiles, and between those many creatures you’ll
      find 97 different species of wild animals. Their most popular inhabitants include the Royal Bengal tigers and
      white tigers, as well as lions, wolves, Hoolock gibbons, Himalayan black bears, and Indian rhinoceros. Those drawn
      to the zoo’s birdlife may find golden pheasants and silver pheasants roaming together, or catch a glimpse of the
      Great Pied Hornbill. This Zoo features ‘Touch Table Programmes’ on Fridays organized by The Nature Interpretation
      Centre.
      <br>
      <b>Rumi Darwaza:</b><br>
      The Rumi Darwaza of Lucknow is one of the most impressive structures in all of India. It was built in the year
      1784
      by Nawab Asaf-ud-daula, under the ‘Food for Work’ program he initiated to help the city’s population get through a
      brutal famine. Completed in that same year, the gateway stands 60 feet tall and was modeled after elaborately
      decorative gateway styles found in Constantinople (which is Istanbul today), adorned with beautifully carved
      flowers
      and designs. Like the Bara Imambara’s arch (which stands to the West of Rumi Darwaza), this structure has no other
      supplementary fittings of wood or iron to support the structure from outside, but it remains steady to this day.
      On
      top of the building, there’s a tower space that once held a massive lantern to light the tower up at night. This
      is
      an especially grand example of Awadhi architecture and well worth a visit.
      <br>
      <b>Ambedkar Park:</b><br>
      A public park and memorial built across 107 acres in Gomti Nagar, Ambedkar Park honors Dr. Ambedkar, Jyotirao
      Phule, Kanshi Ram, Narayana Guru, and many other social reformers who worked for equality and social justice. A
      striking feature of the park is that the whole place is built using red sandstone bought in from Rajasthan. The
      key attractions here include the Ambedkar Stupa, Pratibimb Sthal with statutes of 62 elephants, the museum, and
      Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Gallery, among others.
